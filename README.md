A co-existing website base, with both node and jekyll/ruby.

Eventually, switch the content management jekyll is providing to something else.

Content in `public/` is generated by Jekyll (this is now the `_site` folder).  Avoid creating content in there.

Instead, edit from `src/`

# Install

bundle install
yarn install

# Use

Jekyll is all I have working right now.  Will bring in something else as well,
like React -- ignore most of the yarn/node things for now, we just laid the
foundation for the future.

Run jekyll (content management):

  ./serve
